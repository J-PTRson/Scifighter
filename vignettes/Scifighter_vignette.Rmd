This package is the result of me experimenting with R packages during the "Reproducible Research with R Packages" course provided by the eScience Center Digital Skills Programme.

Scifighter is a science battle game which runs inside your IDE (rstudio) inspired by pokemon. 

## Basic usage

Load the package using:

```{r setup}
library(Scifighter)
```


Once you have loaded the library run the following command to start the game:

```r
gamestart()
```

If you're having audio issues, then you can disable sound using:

```r
gamestart(nosound=TRUE)
```


Have fun!
